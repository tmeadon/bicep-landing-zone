Start with cloning the repo.  

Amend the config files with your own values.  
`./landing-zone/resource-groups.yaml` for the Resource Groups, location and subscription.  
`./landing-zone/environments.yaml` to add your own environments.  
`./landing-zone/networking.yaml` for your VNET needs.  
`./landing-zone/core.yaml` to amend core resources.  

>Note that supported resources are limited to existing resources used in these files.  

### For local use
Install NodeJS  
>Only versions 16.x and 17.x have been tested.  

Run below in Terminal of choice.  
```bash
# Install the required modules:  

npm install

# Convert the YAML config to JSON:  
npm start

# Deploy the Landing Zone:  
npm run deploy
```
